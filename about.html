            <p>
                I'm Ritvika Kedia, a passionate and results-driven Data & Insights Analyst specializing in the AI and TMT sectors. With a solid foundation in psychology and a BSc degree (2:1) from the University of Exeter, I bring a unique, human-centered perspective to data analysis. My journey from understanding human behavior to analyzing complex datasets allows me to generate actionable insights that drive business impact.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my current role as a Data and Insights Analyst at Zeki Research, I have honed my skills in SQL, R, Python, and data visualization tools like Power BI and Flourish, developing bespoke solutions for clients. I've conducted end-to-end quantitative and qualitative analysis, designed visually impactful dashboards, and automated workflows to streamline processes, all while maintaining a strong focus on data quality assurance.
            </p>
            <p>
                I thrive in fast-paced environments where adaptability and strategic thinking are crucial. My background in telecom research at Analysys Mason, combined with my work at Zeki, has equipped me with the skills to analyze trends, predict market changes, and deliver insights that empower decision-makers in AI and technology industries.
            </p>
            <p>
                Driven by curiosity and a love for learning, I continuously seek to improve my technical and analytical skills, while bringing creativity and innovation to my projects. I'm committed to leveraging data to solve complex challenges and create meaningful value for organizations and communities.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not immersed in data, you'll find me exploring the latest developments in AI, volunteering, or working on personal projects that blend technology with human behavior insights.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's connectâ€”I'm always excited to discuss how data can create real-world impact!
